## Key Features of Reinforcement Learning

- In RL, the agent is not instructed about the environment and what actions need to be taken.
- It is based on the hit and trial process.
- The agent takes the next action and changes states according to the feedback of the previous action.
- The agent may get a delayed reward.

## Some key terms that describe the basic elements of an RL problem are:

- Environment  
Physical world in which the agent operates
- State  
Current situation of the agent
- Reward  
Feedback from the environment
- Policy  
Method to map agentâ€™s state to actions
- Value  
Future reward that an agent would receive by taking an action in a particular state

> The environment is stochastic, and the agent needs to explore it to reach to get the maximum positive rewards.
