## 8 Practical Examples of Reinforcement Learning

1. __Robotics__  
Reinforcement learning gives robotics a “framework and a set of tools” for hard-to-engineer behaviours. Since reinforcement learning can happen without supervision, this could help robotics grow exponentially.

2. __Industrial automation__  
Thanks to the reinforcement learning capabilities from DeepMind, Google was able to reduce energy consumption in its data centres dramatically. Bonsai, recently acquired by Microsoft, offers a reinforcement learning solution to automate and “build intelligence into complex and dynamic systems” in energy, HVAC, manufacturing, automotive and supply chains.

3. __Enhance predictive maintenance__  
Machine learning has been used in manufacturing for some time, but reinforcement learning would make predictive maintenance even better than it is today.

4. __Game playing__  
Indeed, the first application in which reinforcement learning gained notoriety was when AlphaGo, a machine learning algorithm, won against one of the world’s best human players in the game Go. Now reinforcement learning is used to compete in all kinds of games.

5. __Medicine__  
Reinforcement learning is ideally suited to figuring out optimal treatments for health conditions and drug therapies. It has also been used in clinical trials as well as for other applications in healthcare.

6. __Dialogue systems__  
Since companies receive a lot of abstract text in the form of customer inquiries, contracts, chatbots and more, solutions that use reinforcement learning for text summaries are highly coveted. Inherent in these tools is they get better over time.

7. __Personalization__  
Whether it’s the media you consume, the advertising that’s targeted to you or the goods you should purchase next on Amazon, there are reinforcement learning algorithms at play behind the scenes to create a stellar customer experience.

8. __Autonomous vehicles__  
Most autonomous cars, trucks, drones, and ships have reinforcement algorithms at the centre. Wayve, a UK company, designed an autonomous vehicle that learned to drive in 20 minutes with the help of reinforcement learning.
