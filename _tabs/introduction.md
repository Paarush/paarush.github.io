## Reinforcement Learning

It is the concept that the optimal behaviour or action is reinforced by a positive reward.

A robot who is learning to walk with reinforcement learning will try
1. different ways to achieve the objective,
2. get feedback about how successful those ways are and then
3. adjust until the aim to walk is achieved.

A big step forward makes the robot fall, so it adjusts its step to make it smaller in order to see if thatâ€™s the secret to staying upright. 

It continues its learning through different variations and ultimately is able to walk. 

In this example, the reward is staying upright, while the punishment is falling.  
Based on the feedback the robot receives for its actions, optimal actions get reinforced.

>It is the science of decision making. It is about learning the optimal behaviour in an environment to obtain maximum reward. This optimal behaviour is learned through interactions with the environment and observations of how it responds, similar to children exploring the world around them and learning the actions that help them achieve a goal.

>In the absence of a supervisor, the learner must independently discover the sequence of actions that maximize the reward. This discovery process is akin to a trial-and-error search. The quality of actions is measured by not just the immediate reward they return, but also the delayed reward they might fetch. As it can learn the actions that result in eventual success in an unseen environment without the help of a supervisor, reinforcement learning is a very powerful algorithm
