# Reinforcement Learning 

It is the concept that the optimal behaviour or action is reinforced by a positive reward.

A robot who is learning to walk with reinforcement learning will try
1. different ways to achieve the objective,
2. get feedback about how successful those ways are and then
3. adjust until the aim to walk is achieved.
A big step forward makes the robot fall, so it adjusts its step to make it smaller in order to see if thatâ€™s the secret to staying upright. 

It continues its learning through different variations and ultimately is able to walk. 

In this example, the reward is staying upright, while the punishment is falling.  
Based on the feedback the robot receives for its actions, optimal actions get reinforced.
